# Eliza Reasoning Visibility Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented all 5 phases of the Supabase AI-inspired reasoning system for Eliza. The system now provides transparent, visible reasoning similar to the Supabase assistant.

## ✅ Implementation Complete

### Phase 1: Reasoning Visibility (Backend) ✓

**Files Modified:**
- `supabase/functions/vercel-ai-chat/index.ts`
- `supabase/functions/vercel-ai-chat-stream/index.ts`
- `supabase/functions/_shared/elizaSystemPrompt.ts`

**Changes:**
1. **Chain-of-Thought Logging**: Added reasoning steps before, during, and after tool calls
2. **Proactive System Checks**: Auto-detects when user mentions database/errors/mining and proactively checks system state
3. **Structured Response Format**: Returns reasoning array with each response containing:
   - `step`: Step number
   - `thought`: What Eliza is thinking
   - `action`: What tool/action she's taking
   - `status`: 'pending' | 'running' | 'success' | 'error'
   - `result`: Tool execution result (if applicable)

**Example Reasoning Output:**
```json
{
  "reasoning": [
    {
      "step": 1,
      "thought": "User mentioned database/tables - proactively checking schema and RLS",
      "action": "Proactive schema_check",
      "status": "success"
    },
    {
      "step": 2,
      "thought": "Executing getMiningStats to gather data",
      "action": "getMiningStats",
      "status": "success",
      "result": { "activeDevices": 3, "hashrate": 125.4 }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Phase 2: Lighten Frontend (React Components) ✓

**Files Created:**
- `supabase/functions/eliza-intelligence-coordinator/index.ts`

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/UnifiedChat.tsx`
- `supabase/config.toml`

**Changes:**
1. **Intelligence Coordinator Edge Function**: Centralizes backend intelligence processing
   - `build_context`: Builds comprehensive context (memory, patterns, preferences)
   - `store_learning`: Stores learning patterns from conversations
   - `get_memory_context`: Retrieves memory for specific topics
   - `update_knowledge_entities`: Updates knowledge graph

2. **Frontend Simplification**: 
   - Moved heavy intelligence processing to backend
   - Frontend now focuses on display and basic state management
   - Intelligence services now called via edge function instead of client-side

3. **Config Update**: Added intelligence coordinator to `config.toml` with JWT verification

### Phase 3: "Think Before Execute" Protocol ✓

**Files Modified:**
- `supabase/functions/_shared/elizaSystemPrompt.ts`

**Changes:**
Added **Reasoning Visibility Protocol** to system prompt:

```
🧠 REASONING VISIBILITY PROTOCOL - CRITICAL

BEFORE EVERY ACTION, YOU MUST PROVIDE VISIBLE REASONING:

1. 🤔 UNDERSTAND: Clearly restate what the user is asking for
2. 📋 PLAN: Explain what you will do and WHY  
3. 🔧 INDICATE TOOLS: State which tools you will use
4. ⚙️ EXECUTE: Run the tools (happens automatically)
5. ✅ ANALYZE: Interpret the results received
6. 💡 RECOMMEND: Provide actionable next steps

PROACTIVE INTELLIGENCE:
- When user mentions "database" or "tables" → Auto-check schema
- When user mentions "error" or "broken" → Auto-check logs  
- When user asks about "system" or "health" → Auto-check metrics
- When user mentions "mining" → Auto-fetch current stats
- Always show your reasoning before executing
```

### Phase 4: Proactive Intelligence ✓

**Files Created:**
- `supabase/functions/_shared/proactiveChecks.ts`

**Functions Implemented:**
1. **onTableMention()**: Auto-checks database schema, RLS policies when user mentions tables
2. **onErrorMention()**: Auto-checks logs and recent errors when user reports issues
3. **onSystemQuery()**: Auto-checks health, active devices, performance when asked about system
4. **onMiningMention()**: Auto-fetches mining stats when user asks about mining

**Usage in Edge Functions:**
```typescript
const proactiveChecks: any[] = [];

if (lowerInput.includes('database') || lowerInput.includes('table')) {
  proactiveChecks.push({
    type: 'schema_check',
    reasoning: 'User mentioned database/tables - proactively checking schema and RLS'
  });
}
```

### Phase 5: Reasoning Visualization UI ✓

**Files Created:**
- `src/components/ReasoningSteps.tsx`

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/UnifiedChat.tsx`
- `src/services/unifiedElizaService.ts`

**Features:**
1. **Collapsible Reasoning Display**: Shows/hides Eliza's thinking process
2. **Step-by-Step Breakdown**: Each step shows:
   - Status icon (pending/running/success/error)
   - Thought process
   - Action taken
   - Execution time
   - Result (expandable)
3. **Visual Indicators**:
   - 🧠 Brain icon for reasoning section
   - ✓ Green checkmark for success
   - ⏱️ Spinning clock for running
   - ❌ Red X for errors
4. **Embedded in Messages**: Reasoning appears above assistant messages

**UI Example:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🧠 Eliza's Reasoning Process     [3 steps] │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ ✓ Step 1 - Completed                    │
│   User mentioned database - checking RLS │
│   Action: Proactive schema_check         │
│   Completed in 245ms                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ ✓ Step 2 - Completed                    │
│   Executing getMiningStats to gather data│
│   Action: getMiningStats                 │
│   Completed in 156ms                     │
│   [View result ▼]                        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```
