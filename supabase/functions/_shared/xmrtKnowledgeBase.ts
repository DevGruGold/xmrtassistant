**XMRT-DAO ECOSYSTEM OVERVIEW:**

The XMRT-DAO is an autonomous decentralized organization built on Ethereum with deep integration into Monero's privacy infrastructure. Our mission is to democratize access to privacy-preserving cryptocurrency mining and Web3 governance through mobile-first technology.

**CORE COMPONENTS:**

1. **XMRT Token (ERC-20)**
   - Contract Address: 0x123... (Ethereum mainnet)
   - Utility: Governance voting, staking rewards, mining pool access
   - Tokenomics: Fixed supply with deflationary burn mechanisms
   
2. **Mobile Mining Infrastructure**
   - MobileMonero.com: Browser-based Monero mining
   - RandomX algorithm optimized for smartphones
   - Pool integration with SupportXMR
   - Real-time hashrate monitoring and earnings tracking
   
3. **DAO Governance System**
   - On-chain proposal creation and voting
   - Quadratic voting to prevent whale dominance
   - Timelock execution for security
   - Treasury management via multi-sig
   
4. **Privacy Bridge Technology**
   - Monero â†” Ethereum asset bridging
   - LayerZero cross-chain messaging
   - Zero-knowledge proof verification
   - Privacy-preserving transaction relaying

5. **AI Agent Orchestration**
   - 8 specialized autonomous agents
   - Task assignment and workload balancing
   - GitHub integration for development
   - Python execution for data analysis
   - Knowledge graph and memory systems

**TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE:**

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity (Ethereum)
- **Backend**: Supabase Edge Functions (Deno)
- **AI**: Lovable AI Gateway (Gemini 2.5 Flash)
- **Voice**: ElevenLabs TTS
- **Storage**: Supabase PostgreSQL + Vector embeddings
- **Mining**: Browser-based WebAssembly RandomX

**PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATIONS:**

Joseph Andrew Lee's vision centers on:
- Economic sovereignty through mobile mining
- Privacy as a fundamental human right
- AI-human collaboration, not replacement
- Decentralized infrastructure without permission
- Sustainable technology with environmental responsibility
- Community-driven governance and education
