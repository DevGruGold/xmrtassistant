## 📊 Monitoring & Verification

### Check Agent Registry

```sql
-- View all agents
SELECT agent_name, display_name, status, priority, execution_count
FROM superduper_agents
ORDER BY priority DESC;

-- View agent statistics
SELECT * FROM superduper_agent_stats;
```

### Check Execution Logs

```sql
-- View recent executions
SELECT * FROM superduper_recent_activity;

-- Count executions by agent
SELECT agent_name, COUNT(*) as execution_count, 
       SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'completed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as successful
FROM superduper_execution_log
GROUP BY agent_name;
```

### Check Agent Performance

```sql
-- View success rates
SELECT 
  agent_name,
  execution_count,
  success_count,
  failure_count,
  ROUND((success_count::NUMERIC / NULLIF(execution_count, 0)) * 100, 2) as success_rate
FROM superduper_agents
WHERE execution_count > 0
ORDER BY execution_count DESC;
```

## 🎯 Database Clarity Verification

### Verify No Agent Confusion

```sql
-- Check for duplicate agent names
SELECT agent_name, COUNT(*) 
FROM superduper_agents 
GROUP BY agent_name 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
-- Expected: 0 rows (no duplicates)

-- Check all agents have unique edge functions
SELECT edge_function_name, COUNT(*) 
FROM superduper_agents 
GROUP BY edge_function_name 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
-- Expected: 0 rows (no duplicates)

-- Verify all agents have complete metadata
SELECT agent_name, 
       CASE WHEN combined_capabilities IS NULL THEN 'MISSING' ELSE 'OK' END as capabilities,
       CASE WHEN core_functions IS NULL THEN 'MISSING' ELSE 'OK' END as functions,
       CASE WHEN use_cases IS NULL THEN 'MISSING' ELSE 'OK' END as use_cases
FROM superduper_agents;
-- Expected: All rows show 'OK'

-- Check for orphaned execution logs
SELECT COUNT(*) as orphaned_logs
FROM superduper_execution_log
WHERE agent_id NOT IN (SELECT id FROM superduper_agents);
-- Expected: 0 (no orphaned logs)
```

### Verify Agent Purpose Clarity

```sql
-- Get complete agent information
SELECT 
  agent_name,
  display_name,
  description,
  jsonb_array_length(core_functions) as function_count,
  jsonb_array_length(combined_capabilities) as capability_count,
  status
FROM superduper_agents
ORDER BY priority DESC;
```

**Expected Output:**
All 10 agents with clear names, descriptions, and capability counts.

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Migration Fails

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check current migration status
supabase db remote ls

# Reset if needed (CAUTION: This will reset the database)
supabase db reset

# Re-apply migration
supabase db push
```

### Issue: Edge Function Deploy Fails

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check function logs
supabase functions logs superduper-router --tail

# Verify function syntax
deno check supabase/functions/superduper-router/index.ts

# Redeploy
supabase functions deploy superduper-router --no-verify-jwt
```

### Issue: Agent Execution Fails

**Debugging Steps:**

1. **Check Supabase logs:**
```bash
supabase functions logs superduper-router --tail
supabase functions logs superduper-finance-investment --tail
```

2. **Verify agent is active:**
```sql
SELECT agent_name, status FROM superduper_agents WHERE agent_name = 'superduper-finance-investment';
```

3. **Check execution logs:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM superduper_execution_log 
WHERE status = 'failed' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

4. **Test directly:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://vawouugtzwmejxqkeqqj.supabase.co/functions/v1/superduper-router \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ANON_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "agent_name": "superduper-finance-investment",
    "action": "list_agents",
    "params": {}
  }'
```
