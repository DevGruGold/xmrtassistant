• Thermal management and battery optimization for sustainability
• RandomX algorithm specifically tuned for ARM processors
• Dynamic hashrate adjustment based on device capabilities

🕸️ XMRT MESHNET & PRIVACY-FIRST INFRASTRUCTURE
• Decentralized peer-to-peer communication networks
• Privacy as a fundamental right, not a crime
• Censorship-resistant mesh network topology
• Token-incentivized node participation
• Fault-tolerant connectivity independent of traditional infrastructure

🏗️ TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE & PHILOSOPHY
• React/Vite frontend with real-time mobile-first dashboard
• Python Flask backend with smart contract integration
• Solidity governance contracts with verifiable autonomy
• Bridge technology connecting private and public blockchains
• Comprehensive security and audit frameworks

🌱 SUSTAINABLE TECHNOLOGY ETHICS
